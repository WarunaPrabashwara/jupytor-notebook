    "Compaired to first method , socond method has secial features . Socond one doesn't use recurtion . We can pass the maximum number of guesses to second one so unline in first one , we can keep an asuarance that the software will not make us failed in the game when we automate the game . As well as in the second method although we provide the maxumum number of routing to circulate , if the algorithm will find the correct answer before ending all the rounds , the algo will give us the answer without wasting time or taking the other chances of the game .  As the assignment advices us to use the previous code in the answer one . I have used that one also to do few changes in the code . "
