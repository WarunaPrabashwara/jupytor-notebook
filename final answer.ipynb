    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Wordle is a word game where the player has six tries to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the player gains information about  which letters of the guess are in the correct position. For example, if the actual hidden word was \"AGREE\" and the guess was \"ABORE\", the player would see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![AGREE_ABORE](imgs/AGREE_ABORE.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The green 'A' and 'E' means that the letters 'A' and 'E' are in their correct positions; the black 'B' and 'O' means that the word contains neither more 'B's nor more 'O's; and the yellow 'R' means that there is an 'R' somewhere in the word, but not in that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of a successful guess sequence, refer to the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DWARF_SEQUENCE](imgs/DWARF_SEQUENCE.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to play the original Wordle game, you can find it [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). However, since this website only updates the word to be guessed daily, the solution to the game will remain the same throughout the day. If you would like to try out the game with a different word each time, click [here](https://metzger.media/games/wordle-archive/?random=play) instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest that you give it a go and familiarise yourself with the game!\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "When testing, we may use a word list that differs from that in words.txt. So, **DO NOT** hard code your solution based on that! However, you can rest assured that the word list provided is the full word list used in the original game of Wordle, and hence, your solver will be able to work on the original game.\n"

    "## Game Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start implementing a solver for Wordle, it will be really helpful to understand the details of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restrictions on Guess Words\n",
    "We are only allowed to guess real words. To be more specific, entered words will be checked against a word list and if the word is not inside, it will be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Coloured Letters\n",
    "In the case of guess words with unique letters, the meanings are quite straightforward. Green means that the word contains those letters in the same position, yellow means that the word contains those letters but in another position and black means that the word does not contain those letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, when the guess word has repeated letters, things get a little more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a repeated letter is coloured green in one position but yellow in another, it means that the former is correctly positioned but the latter exists in another position. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![SOGGY_GIGAS](imgs/SOGGY_GIGAS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The green 'G' in this guess word means that the actual hidden word has a 'G' in the 3rd position while the yellow 'G' means that there is at least another 'G' in either the 2nd, 4th or 5th position of the actual hidden word.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first 'G' was black however, it would have meant that the actual hidden word **did not have a 'G' in the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th position**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a repeated letter being coloured yellow in one position and black in another, it means that the actual hidden word contains **one** such letter but it is not in either of the chosen positions. For example, suppose that we have the result shown in the figure below. Then, the fact that the last 'G' is black implies that there is only one 'G', and in this case, it must be in either the 3rd or 4th position (if 'A' was not green, the 1st position would have been also a possibility). Furthermore, there is no 'G' in the 2nd and 5th position.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ANGEL_AGING](imgs/ANGEL_AGING.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A last case that we shall explicitly discuss here is as follows. Suppose that a letter is repeated thrice, and it is coloured green, yellow and black in different positions. Then, it means that there are only two instances of it in the actual word, with one instance of it correctly positioned and the other incorrectly positioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, if we have the result shown in the figure below, it means that there is an 'A' in the first position, and there is only one other 'A', which must be in either the 2nd or 4th position.\n",
    "\n",
    "![AHEAP_ABACA](imgs/AHEAP_ABACA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more cases, but the aforementioned cases should give you a general idea of how things work. If you still have any doubts about it, checkout the function `make_evaluate_guess` that will generate the colour sequence based on the chosen actual word and the guess word."

    "## Part 1: Naive Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the problem set, we will implement a naive solver that will use the result of each guess to narrow down the possible words. With a smaller set of possible words to choose from, we can then make another guess, iteratively narrowing down the possibilities until we are in a state that has only one possible word or until we have found the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more precise, for part 1, our solver will work like this:\n",
    "1. Randomly choose a word from the list of possible words.\n",
    "2. After making our guess, we will narrow down our list of possible words by excluding words that cannot possibly be the actual hidden word, based on the result which we obtained from our guess.\n",
    "3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until we are left with one possible word or we guess the actual hidden word along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have abstracted the solver into different functions to make things easier. Please refer to the empty TODO sections below for these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** in this problem set, **we are lifting the six-guesses restriction**, so it's possible to make more than six guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** your algorithms SHOULD work for words of length $n$, where $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$, not only words of length 5."

    "You may have realised that although the solver is able to guarantee that we can find the solution in a finite number of steps, it is not very effective -- it is unlikely (except if you are very lucky) that we will be able to guess the word within six guesses (like in the real game). This is because the naive solver is only focused on *exploiting* what we have learnt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example that illustrates this. Let's say that we have narrowed down our search space to only P-INT. There are three possible words: 'POINT', 'PAINT' and 'PRINT'. With our naive solver, in the worst case, we will guess all three before we get the solution. However, if we were to guess a very different word like 'AROMA', we would have been able to tell which letter, out of 'O', 'A' and 'R', existed in the actual word. With this information, we would have only needed one more trial to enter the actual word. As such, with this approach, we would have only needed two attempts in total, instead of three in the worst case to get the actual word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aforementioned example illustrates how exploration -- by guessing the word 'AROMA', which deviates significantly from what we were working towards, namely a word in the form P-INT -- can be more beneficial than (immediate) exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, the benefits of exploration is not always guaranteed. For example, if, on the extreme, we had just randomly selected a word like 'SIEVE' from the list of all words, it wouldn't have been very useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the exploitation vs exploration trade-off comes into play. We have to find a middle ground between making a safe play (by guessing only possible words) and guessing words that may be impossible but may give more information. If successful, we will be able to reduce the number of trials needed to find the word. In other words, it is helpful to have a heuristic or evaluation function  that makes an impossible guess if and only if it is likely that the guess will give us more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in task 2, it is time for you to show us how deft you are at balancing the exploitation vs exploration trade-off to solve Wordle more 'smartly'!"

    "### Task 2.1: Making Better Guesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `generate_smart_guess(word_list, possible_words, nth_guess)` that returns a \"smarter\" guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the ultimate goal of Wordle is to guess the word within a given number of tries (e.g. in the actual game, 6 tries when there are 5 letters). Hence, **a \"smarter\" guess is one that enables our solver to solve the games, on average, with fewer guesses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this function, `possible_words` is the list of possible remaining words and `word_list` is the entire initial list of words. Additionally, `nth_guess` is a positive integer that indicates which trial -- since the start of the game -- this guess is for, i.e. `generate_smart_guess(word_list, possible_words, 1)` will generate the first guess, `generate_smart_guess(word_list, possible_words, 2)` will generate the second guess and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our smart(er) solver will then run the same algorithm as in part 1, but with the first step modified. In particular, it should work as follows:\n",
    "1. Make an intelligent guess using `generate_smart_guess`.\n",
    "2. After making our guess, we will narrow down our list of possible words by excluding words that cannot possibly be the actual hidden word, based on the result which we obtained from our guess.\n",
    "3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until we are left with one possible word or we guess the actual hidden word along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to code out the smart(er) solver, but it is **NOT** required. Instead, for task 2.1, you are only required to submit your implementation for `generate_smart_guess`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Formulate the problem as a search problem, and think about which strategies are the most appropriate for this problem. Will local search work? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The test cases provided on Coursemology only checks for the correctness of your solution, i.e. whether `generate_smart_guess` retains the actual hidden word. Therefore, passing the test cases **DOES NOT** mean that your heuristic is 'good' (and consequently, will be awarded full credit). In addition, please ensure that your implementation runs within reasonable time limits; solutions that take too long to run will be penalised."

    "In this code , we use a interligent way to solve our problem . assume that there is a word as \"aaaaa\" in our list . so if we take that word as our first random value to go future , it  will give us a really poor quality final answer . because it looks like the word has five letters ,, but in the comparison we have actually compaired only one letter . The letter is \"a\" . So if we take such kind of a random word , it will be a raal waste of our try . So the method I use it bit advanced . when I request a randomword from a random word generator , it doesm't just create a randomword . instead , the function go through the entire word list and make an array of words which words have the maximum number of different words . In this example , the maximum different amount of letters that a word can have is five . But if we don't have ay single word with 5 different words , then the algo checks the top most word with the maximum frequency of letters . So probably it is four . If the words don't have a letter with four different letters it step down to check if there is a word with 3 different letters . Likewise it gets counted down . "
